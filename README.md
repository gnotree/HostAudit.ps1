# HostAudit.ps1
Host-Audit.ps1 performs a fast Windows integrity audit. It verifies DISM/SFC health, checks Defender status, lists mini-filter and kernel drivers with SHA256 hashes, and highlights non-Microsoft entries. Results are logged under T:\GNO-JUNGLE\Jaguar\Reports\HostAudit and open in Explorer by default.
